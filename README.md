# Scrimba-Javascriptmas-2024
Completing Scrimba's Javascriptmas' daily code challenges for the month of December.

Day 1 - Grandpa's Gift List__
Tasks completed:__
  1. Ensure no duplicates can be added to the list.
  2. Account for extra spaces at the beginning/end and between words.
  3. Case Sensitivity: Handle cases where capitalization differs. For example:
   - `"Cat Hammock"` should be flagged as a duplicate of `"cat hammock"`.
   - Preserve Grandpaâ€™s original capitalization (e.g., if `"Cat Hammock"` is added first, that should be added to the list). Do not simply convert all entries to lower case -   Grandpa might well want to capitalize some words.
Methods I've learned:__
  1. Using .replace() method with regex
  2. Using .some() method to test for duplicates
  3. Using .toLowerCase() method to convert letters to lowercase

Day 2 - Ugly Advent Calendar
